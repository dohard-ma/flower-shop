# Global Rules for TypeScript Development

## Language and Core Preferences

- Always use TypeScript for all code in JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Ensure strict type checking, interfaces for props/data, and avoid 'any' type unless absolutely necessary.
- Generate modular, functional code with clear separation of concerns. Use async/await for promises and handle errors with try-catch.

## CSS Class Naming Conventions

- Adopt semantic, abstract naming based on morphological or structural levels. Focus on the functional form rather than specific content.
  - For example: Use 'list' for any image list or item collection, not 'img-list' or 'photo-list'.
  - Use 'container' for wrappers, 'item' for list elements, 'button' for interactive controls, 'header' for top sections.
  - Avoid content-specific prefixes like 'img-', 'photo-'; prioritize hierarchy and behavior, e.g., 'upload-area' instead of 'file-upload-zone'.
- Class names should be short, lowercase with hyphens, and describe the UI morphology (e.g., 'grid-layout' for grid-based displays).

## CSS Styling Rules

- Always use nested CSS definitions to reflect component hierarchy, similar to SCSS/Sass. Structure styles with parent-child nesting for readability.
  - Example for a container with an upload list:
    .container {
      padding: 10rpx;

      .upload-list {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        gap: 10rpx;

        .list-item {
          border: 1px solid #ccc;
          padding: 8rpx;
        }
      }
    }
- Prefer CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components or emotion in React/TS projects) if applicable, but fallback to vanilla CSS with nesting when possible. Use rpx or rem for responsive units.
- Ensure mobile-first design: Start with base styles for small screens, then add media queries for larger ones. Include flexbox or grid for layouts.

## Additional Guidelines

- When generating components, include TypeScript interfaces for props (e.g., interface UploadListProps { items: string[]; }).
- Comment complex sections briefly, focusing on why, not what.
- Optimize for performance: Avoid deep nesting in CSS beyond 3 levels; use utility classes sparingly.
